This is a very simple ESP cheat (Radar hack and glow-hack) for cs2

It is an external user mode application that reads and writes process memory via a custom kernel driver.

i will note provide any instruction on how to compile it nor how to use it since it was made for learning purpose only, 
also i think is very difficult to run it since the driver is not signed.
